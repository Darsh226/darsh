<p>NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) is a group of 7 satellites developed by ISRO. 
This system provides a Global Positioning System (GPS) service in India. It provides real-time positioning and timing services.</p>
<p>NavIC's reliable navigation services help during natural disasters by improving coordination in emergency response efforts. 
With location accuracy and continuous coverage, it enables better planning, monitoring, and communication in disaster-stricken areas,
 which is crucial for timely rescue and relief operations.</p>
<p> GPS uses a single frequency band, while NavIC uses dual frequency in the L5 and S bands of the microwave spectrum for signalling.
 Therefore, compared to GPS's 20-metre positioning accuracy, NavIC offers a better accuracy of 10 metres throughout the Indian landmass.</p>
